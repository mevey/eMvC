Following on experience I gained using development frameworks such as Codeigniter, Kohana and Yii, I have custom-built my very own Model-View-Controller framework. For each project I embark on, I can customize and tailor it to meet the specific needs and dynamics of the current project.

It has numerous features missing in many other frameworks, such as the ability to act as a basic REST-API as-is (and with a little modification, can act as a fully fledged REST-API). Additionally, it has support for SSL (https), making it easy for developers to ensure parts of their applications are always accessed securely by simply setting a flag for specific "controllers" (the parts of MVC applications where core business logic is handled).

Inputs via "POST" and "GET" HTTP requests are automatically sanitized, and as a major convenience for developers, database-model classes can be auto-generated on the fly. Moreover, it has extensive support for having both mobile and desktop templates in applications developed using it, employing the use of a thorough device-type detection mechanism. Also missing in many other frameworks and present in eveMVC is support for sub-domains, where the current sub-domain used to access the app is available to developers in single variable. Additionally, specific sub-domains can be mapped to defined sets of "controllers".
