eMVC

It has numerous features missing in many other frameworks, such as the ability to act as a basic REST-API as-is (and with a little modification, can act as a fully fledged REST-API). Additionally, it has support for SSL (https), making it easy for developers to ensure parts of their applications are always accessed securely by simply setting a flag for specific "controllers" (the parts of MVC applications where core business logic is handled).

Inputs via "POST" and "GET" HTTP requests are automatically sanitized, and as a major convenience for developers, database-model classes can be auto-generated on the fly. Moreover, it has extensive support for having both mobile and desktop templates in applications developed using it, employing the use of a thorough device-type detection mechanism. Also missing in many other frameworks and present in eveMVC is support for sub-domains, where the current sub-domain used to access the app is available to developers in single variable. Additionally, specific sub-domains can be mapped to defined sets of "controllers".
